1.  stdint.h declares integer types with specific widths .
2.  uint8_t, unitn16_t, uint32_t, and uint64_t are equivilant to newer unsigned data types,
    such as char, short, int, and long long. Recommended use is when representing a bit pattern
    or defined modulo overflow.
3.  a BYTE is one BYTE, DWORD contains 4 bytes, Long contains 4 Bytes, WORD contains 2 Bytes
4.  The first two bytes of a BMP file are BM in ASCII
5.  The difference between bfSize and biSize is
    bfSize is the size of the entire file, where
    biSize is the number of bytes required by the BITMAPINFOHEADER.
6.  If biHeight is negative the top row is at the end of the BMP file.
7.  The field that specifies the BMP's color depth in BITMAPINFOHEADER is biClrUsed.
8.  fopen might return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c because it failed to read
    or failed to write to the file.
9.  The third argument to fread is always 1 in the code because fread is told to read
    one element.
10. In copy.c line 65 assigns 3 to padding if bi.biWidth is 3.
11. fseek sets the file position of the stream to go to the given offset.
12. SEEK_CUR is the current postion of the file pointer.
